My notes:
---------

- affordances
  - intuition/learned expectations based on previous experiences (how paper feels)
  -
  
- material design
  - imagine UIs are pieces of paper, called surfaces
  - in general, objects that are closer to us command more of our visual attantion
    - make objects appear closer based on size and how they cast shadows
    - so use depth as a cue in our UI to direct attention to our important elements
      - SO SURFACES NEAR TO YOU WILL CAST A LARGER SHADOW
  
- surface
  - container for your content
  - provides groupng and seperation from other elemnts
  - ie:
    - for list view, put app bar and list on seperate surfaces
    - do not split items in list into individual surfaces
      - that makes reading through and slower and scanning harder; easier when on same surface
      - use subtle seperator instead
  - ie:
    - google notes
      - use seperate items in list as seperate surfaces since they are not related
  - rules
    - if content is homogenous and scanning/comparing is important
      - belongs on shared surface
      - use simple line seperator (like contacts list)
    - for collection of heterogeneous items, then each have their own surface (like Google Keep)
    - too many surfaces on screen at once can be distracting
      - try to avoid having more than 5 surfaces on the screen at once

  - in android
    - surface is a container that cast a shadow
    - create them by setting 'background' and 'elevation' values in the layout elements
    
- elevation
  - standard elevations
        Nav drawer: 16dp
        App bar: 4dp
        Card: 1dp to 8dp
        FAB: 6dp
        Button: 2dp to 8dp
        Dialog: 24dp

- floating action button
  - FAB
    - vibrant button that floats above rest of content in your app
    - way of promoting prominent action
    - have standrd sizes and elevations
      - 40dp or 56dp
      - usually have resting elevation of 6dp rising to 12 dp when pressed
    - only use a single fab per screen
    - if unclear which action should be a FAB, then probably don't need one on that screen
    - FABs are meant for actions (new, scan, etc), not links to lists or settings
    
    - gradle dependencies
      - compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:222.2.2'
      - compile 'com.android.support:design:22.2.0'
      
      - in activity_main.xml
        <android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton
          app:fabSize="normal"                          (56 dp)
          app:elevation="6dp"
          app:layout_gravity="end"                      (to right)
          app:pressedTranslationZ="12dp"
          
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android_layout_width-"wrap_content"
          android:layout_margin="16dp"
          andrroid:id="@+id/fab_id"
          android:src="@drawable/fab_plus"
        />
        
      - to run, need to replace style from material to appcompat
        - ie:
          <style name="AppTheme" parent="android:Theme.Material.Light"/>
          with
          <style name="AppTheme" parent="android:Theme.AppCompat.Light"/>
          
- response to touch
  - ripple effect on touch
    - for borderless elements, ripple will go to edge of elements invisible area
    - already included in the FAB library
  - user initiated radial response

- paper transformations
  - circular reveals (lesson 15); gradual UI change between 2 looks/data
    - ie:
    Animator anim = ViewAnimationUtils.createCircularReveal(view, (int)view.getWidth()/2, (int)view.getHeight()/2, 0, finalRaduis);
    view.getTexrView().setText("test");
    view.setBackgroundColor(green);
    anim.start();
    
    
  - collapsing toolbar
    - as list view scrolls to app bar, the app bar shrinks and lifts up to let items scroll below it
    - use collapsing toolbar library/layout
      - called seam to step transition
      - start with CoordinatorLayout
        - android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout
        
        
- final
  - looked at how to use surfaces when scrolling and touching and how they react
    - scroll content above/below or with toolbar
