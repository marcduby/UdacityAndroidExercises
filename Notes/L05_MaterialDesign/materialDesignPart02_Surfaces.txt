My notes:
---------

- afordances
  - intuition/learned expectations based on previous experiences (how paper feels)
  -
  
- material design
  - imagine UIs are pieces of paper, called surfaces
  - in general, objects that are closer to us command more of our visual attantion
    - make objects appear closer based on size and how they cast shadows
    - so use depth as a cue in our UI to direct attention to our important elements
      - SO SURFACES NEAR TO YOU WILL CAST A LARGER SHADOW
  
- surface
  - container for your content
  - provides groupng and seperation fromother elemnts
  - ie:
    - for list view, put app bar and list on seperate surfaces
    - do not split items in list into individual surfaces
      - that lakes reading through and slower and scanning harder
      - use subtle seperator
  - ie:
    - google notes
      - use seperate items in list as seperate surfaces since they are not related
  - rules
    - if contanet is homogenous and scanning/comparing is important
      - belongs on shared surface
      - use simple line seperator
    - for collection of heterogeneous items, then each have their own surface
    - too many suraces on screen at once can be distracting
      - try to avoid having more than 5 on screen at once

  - in android
    - surface is a container that cast a shadow
    - create them by setting 'bakground' and 'elevation' values in the layout elements
    
- elevation
  - standard elevations
        Nav drawer: 16dp
        App bar: 4dp
        Card: 1dp to 8dp
        FAB: 6dp
        Button: 2dp to 8dp
        Dialog: 24dp

- floating action button
  - FAB
    - vibrant button that floats above rest of content in your app
    - way of promoting prominet action
    - have standrd sizes and elevations
      - 40dp or 56dp
      - usually have resting elevation of 6dp rising to 12 dp when pressed
    - only use single fab per screen
    - if unclear which action should be a FAB, then probably don't need one on that screen
    - FABs are meant for actions (new, scan, etc), not links to lists or settings
