My Notes
--------

- gradle has tasks
  - can be nested
  - can have inputs/outputs
  
- gradlew
  - gradle wrapper
  - will pass through command if gradle already installed
  - if not, gradle will be installed
  
- gradle daemon
  - android studio always uses the daemon, which mitigates gradel startup times
  - from command line, have to manually instantiate thee daemon
